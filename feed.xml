		<title>Fixing Tuning and Pitch Bending Problems in a Korg Poly 800</title>

		<description>The Korg Poly 800 is a classic mid-tier 80s synth.
		It uses a rare mix of analog and digital sound generation to make a sort of square-wave organ not seen in many other synthesizers.
		Over the past couple years the tuning slider of mine has intermittently ceased functioning.</description>

		<title>Dimming a Stellarvue Red Dot Sight</title>

		<description>
			I bought the Stellarvue Multi-Reticle Finder (MRF)last year.
			Apparently it was originally designed as a sight for rifles but wasn't strong enough to maintain alignment between shots.
			This is no problem for amateur astronomy, in which you don't expect your telescope to experience large shocks.
			It makes for a high-quality and relatively compact red-dot finder.
			After all these years though, no one has bothered to change the LED to one suited for nighttime use even though it's marketed by Stellarvue as a telescope view finder.</description>
